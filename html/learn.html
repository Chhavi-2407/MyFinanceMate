          <summary>1. What is a Budget?</summary>
          <p>A budget is a plan for your money. It helps you track what comes in (income) and what goes out (expenses). Think of it as a roadmap for your financial journey!</p>
        </details>
        <details><summary>2. The 50/30/20 Rule</summary>
        <p>This simple rule suggests: 50% of income for needs (rent, food), 30% for wants (entertainment, dining out), and 20% for savings and debt repayment. It's a great starting point!</p></details>
        <details><summary>3. Tracking Your Expenses</summary>
        <p>Write down everything you spend for one month. You'll be surprised where your money goes! Use apps, spreadsheets, or even a notebook. Awareness is the first step to control.</p></details>
        <details><summary>4. Creating Your First Budget</summary>
        <p>List your monthly income, then list all expenses. Subtract expenses from income. If it's negative, cut some wants. If positive, increase savings! Review and adjust monthly.</p></details>

          <summary>1. Why Save Money?</summary>
          <p>Savings provide security for emergencies, help you reach goals, and reduce financial stress. Even small amounts grow over time with compound interest!</p>
        </details>
        <details><summary>2. Emergency Fund Basics</summary>
        <p>An emergency fund is money set aside for unexpected expenses (medical bills, car repairs). Aim for 3-6 months of living expenses. Start with $500, then build gradually.</p></details>
        <details><summary>3. Savings Goals & Strategies</summary>
        <p>Set specific goals (vacation in 6 months, laptop in 1 year). Break them into monthly targets. Automate transfers to savings on payday. Pay yourself first!</p></details>
        <details><summary>4. High-Yield Savings Accounts</summary>
        <p>These accounts offer higher interest rates than regular savings accounts. Your money grows faster! Compare rates online and choose FDIC-insured banks for safety.</p></details>

        <details>
          <summary>1. What is Investing?</summary>
          <p>Investing means putting your money into assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) that can grow in value over time. Unlike savings, investments carry risk but offer higher potential returns.</p>
        </details>
        <details><summary>2. Stocks vs. Bonds</summary>
        <p>Stocks are shares of companies. You own a tiny piece! Bonds are loans to companies/governments. Stocks are riskier but grow faster. Bonds are safer but grow slower. Diversify!</p></details>
        <details><summary>3. Understanding Risk & Return</summary>
        <p>Higher potential returns usually mean higher risk. Young investors can take more risk because they have time to recover from losses. As you age, shift to safer investments.</p></details>
        <details><summary>4. Index Funds & Mutual Funds</summary>
        <p>These funds pool money from many investors to buy a mix of stocks/bonds. They're diversified and managed by professionals. Great for beginners! Lower risk than individual stocks.</p></details>
        <details>
          <summary>5. Starting Small with SIPs</summary>
          <p>Systematic Investment Plans let you invest small amounts regularly (like ₹500/month). This builds wealth and reduces risk through cost averaging.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="lesson-content">
        <details><summary>1. Understanding Credit Scores</summary>
        <p>Your credit score (300-850) shows how reliable you are at repaying debt. Higher scores = better loan rates. Pay bills on time, keep credit card balances low, and check your score regularly.</p></details>
        <details><summary>2. Good Debt vs. Bad Debt</summary>
        <p>Good debt helps you build wealth (student loans, mortgage). Bad debt comes from overspending on wants (high-interest credit cards). Avoid bad debt and manage good debt wisely!</p></details>
        <details><summary>3. Credit Card Basics</summary>
        <p>Credit cards are convenient but dangerous if misused. Pay the full balance every month to avoid interest. Never spend more than you can repay. Treat it like a debit card!</p></details>

        <details><summary>1. Why You Need Insurance</summary>
        <p>Insurance protects you from big financial losses (medical emergencies, accidents). Pay a small premium regularly instead of a huge bill suddenly. Health insurance is essential!</p></details>
        <details><summary>2. Avoiding Financial Scams</summary>
        <p>Never share passwords or OTPs. Verify before clicking links. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Research before investing. Protect your financial information!</p></details>
        <details><summary>3. Identity Theft Prevention</summary>
        <p>Use strong, unique passwords. Enable two-factor authentication. Monitor bank statements regularly. Shred financial documents before discarding. Be cautious with personal information online.</p></details>
